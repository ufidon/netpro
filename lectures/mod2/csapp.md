## Function `socket.socket(family=-1, type=-1, proto=-1, fileno=None)`
- used to create a new socket object
  - which is an endpoint for sending and receiving data across a network. 
- provides low-level networking interfaces.


### **`socket.socket()` signature**

```python
socket.socket(family=AF_INET, type=SOCK_STREAM, proto=0, fileno=None)
```

### **Formal Arguments**

| **Argument** | **Description**      | **Common Values**     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **`family`** | Specifies the address family of the socket. This determines the type of addresses that the socket can communicate with.                                   | `AF_INET`, `AF_INET6`, `AF_UNIX`             |
| **`type`**   | Specifies the socket type, which determines the communication semantics (e.g., stream or datagram).                                                       | `SOCK_STREAM`, `SOCK_DGRAM`, `SOCK_RAW`      |
| **`proto`**  | Specifies the protocol to be used with the socket. The default is `0`, which lets the operating system select the appropriate protocol based on the type. | Usually set to `0`, or protocol-specific value |
| **`fileno`** | Can be used to wrap an existing socket file descriptor (optional). When `None`, a new socket is created.                                                  | `None` (default)                             |


### **Explanation and Usage**

- **`family`:** Determines the type of addresses your socket can communicate with. 
  - For most internet-based applications, you will use `AF_INET` for IPv4 or `AF_INET6` for IPv6.
- **`type`:** Determines the communication style. 
  - For example, `SOCK_STREAM` is used for TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) communications, 
  - while `SOCK_DGRAM` is used for UDP (unreliable, connectionless) communications.
- **`proto`:** This is usually left as `0` to allow the OS to choose the correct protocol based on the type. 
  - However, for specific applications like raw sockets, you might specify a protocol directly.
- **`fileno`:** Used in advanced scenarios where you want to wrap an existing file descriptor in a socket object.

### üçé **Example Usage**

```python
import socket

# Creating a TCP/IP socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Binding the socket to an address and port
sock.bind(('localhost', 8080))

# Listening for incoming connections
sock.listen(5)

# Accept a connection
connection, client_address = sock.accept()

# Receive and send data
data = connection.recv(1024)
connection.sendall(data)

# Close the connection
connection.close()

# Close the socket
sock.close()
```


## `with` statement
- with objects that support the `context management protocol`
  - which implements the __enter__ and __exit__ methods

```python
with expression as variable: # 1. `expression` returns a context manager object
    # 2. Clause `as variable` is optional. The object returned by the __enter__ method is assigned to the variable. 
    #   This variable can then be used within the block
    # 3. Code block (body of the with statement)
    #   The variable can be used here
    # 4. When the block is exited, the __exit__ method is automatically called, 
    #   even if the block is exited due to an exception.

```

|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| ```python                  | ```python                    |
| import socket              | import socket                |
|                            |                              |
| with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s: | s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) |
|  | try:                        |
| s.connect(('localhost', 65432))  |     s.connect(('localhost', 65432)) |
| s.sendall(b'Hello, world') |     s.sendall(b'Hello, world') |
| data = s.recv(1024) |     data = s.recv(1024)        |
| print('Received', repr(data)) |     print('Received', repr(data)) |
|                            | finally:                    |
| # The socket is automatically closed  |     s.close()               |
| ```                        | ```                         |


### **Comparison**

- **Resource Management:**
  - **With `with`:** The socket is automatically closed when the block is exited, ensuring proper resource management without needing to explicitly call `close()`.
  - **Without `with`:** You have to manually close the socket using `s.close()` in a `finally` block to ensure it is closed even if an exception occurs.

- **Code Simplicity:**
  - **With `with`:** The code is cleaner and more concise since it abstracts away the cleanup process.
  - **Without `with`:** The code requires additional boilerplate (`try`/`finally` block) to ensure proper resource management, making it more verbose.

- **Error Handling:**
  - **With `with`:** The `with` statement automatically handles the cleanup of the socket, even if an exception occurs within the block.
  - **Without `with`:** The `finally` block ensures that the socket is closed, but you have to explicitly write this, making it prone to errors if forgotten.

In general, using `with` is recommended for managing resources like sockets, files, and locks in Python because it simplifies code and reduces the risk of resource leaks.

## Blocking and Non-Blocking Modes

- **Blocking Mode**: Functions typically wait until the operation can be completed (e.g., until data is received, a connection is made, etc.).
- **Non-Blocking Mode**: Functions return immediately and may raise a `BlockingIOError` exception if the operation would block. This allows the program to continue running other tasks while waiting for the socket operation to complete.

| `errno.EADDRNOTAVAIL`      | Address Not Available   | 99                  | The specified address is not available on the local machine.                    |
| `errno.ECONNABORTED`       | Connection Aborted      | 103                 | The connection was aborted by the operating system.                             |
| `errno.ECONNREFUSED`       | Connection Refused      | 111                 | The target machine actively refused the connection (no service on the port).    |
| `errno.ECONNRESET`         | Connection Reset        | 104                 | The connection was reset by the peer (often due to network issues).             |
| `errno.EHOSTUNREACH`       | Host Unreachable        | 113                 | The target host is unreachable, possibly due to network or routing issues.      |
| `errno.ENETDOWN`           | Network Down            | 100                 | The local network interface is down.                                            |
| `errno.ENETUNREACH`        | Network Unreachable     | 101                 | The network is unreachable, possibly due to routing issues.                     |
| `errno.ENOTCONN`           | Socket Not Connected    | 107                 | An operation was attempted on a socket that is not connected.                   |
| `errno.ETIMEDOUT`          | Connection Timed Out    | 110                 | The connection attempt timed out.                                               |
| `errno.EPIPE`              | Broken Pipe             | 32                  | The connection was broken by the remote peer, typically while writing data.     |

## **Socket Errors Common to Client and Server**

```python
import socket

try:
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.settimeout(5)
    s.connect(('example.com', 80))  # Or s.bind(('localhost', 8080)) for server
    # Simulate sending/receiving data...
except socket.timeout:
    print("The connection timed out!")
except socket.gaierror as e:
    print(f"Address-related error occurred: {e}")
except socket.error as e:
    if e.errno == socket.errno.ECONNRESET:
        print("Connection reset by the peer.")
    else:
        print(f"Socket error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    s.close()
```

## **Server-Specific Socket Errors**

```python
import socket

try:
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind(('localhost', 8080))
    server_socket.listen(5)
    print("Server is listening...")
except socket.error as e:
    if e.errno == socket.errno.EADDRINUSE:
        print("Port is already in use. Please choose another port.")
    else:
        print(f"Socket error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    server_socket.close()
```

---

## **Client-Specific Socket Errors**

```python
import socket

try:
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    client_socket.connect(('invalid-domain', 80))
    # Simulate sending/receiving data...
except socket.gaierror as e:
    print(f"Address-related error occurred: {e}")
except socket.herror as e:
    print(f"Host-related error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    client_socket.close()
```
