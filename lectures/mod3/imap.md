[Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol)
---
- an Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection
- An IMAP server typically listens on port number 143
  - IMAP over SSL/TLS (IMAPS) is assigned the port number 993
- popular IMAP clients: ThunderBird, Outlook
- defined in [RFC 9051: Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - Version 4rev2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9051)


Advantages of IMAP over POP
---
- supports operations below on an IMAP server 
  - sorts mails into several folders
    - folders can be shared with other users or marked read-only
  - flags messages as "read", "replied", "seen", "deleted", "archived", etc.
  - searches text strings from messages
  - maintains persistent unique message numbers for synchronization between local message store and remote server
    - A locally stored message can be uploaded directly to one of the remote folders
  - Some IMAP servers can present nonmail sources, like Usenet newsgroups, as though they were e-mail folders
  - An IMAP client can selectively download only one part of a message such as an attachment or the message header


IMAP in Python
---
- supports by Python libraries
  - [imaplib ‚Äî IMAP4 protocol client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html)
  - [IMAPClient ‚Äî an easy-to-use, Pythonic and complete IMAP client library](https://imapclient.readthedocs.io/)
  - Exceptions:
    - socket.error, socket.gaierror, IMAP4.error, IMAP4.abort, IMAP4.readonly
- to implement a full-featured IMAP client, refer to
  - [Best Practices for Implementing an IMAP Client](https://www.imapwiki.org/ClientImplementation)


üñäÔ∏è Practice
---
- the PSL *imaplib* offers basic IMAP access
  - sends requests by wrapping IMAP commands
  - receives raw IMAP responses without further parsing
- [Connecting to IMAP and Listing Folders](./imap/open_imaplib.py)
  ```python
  python3 open_imaplib.py localhost seed
  ```

[IMAPClient]((https://imapclient.readthedocs.io/))
---
- implements several details of the IMAP protocol on [imaplib]((https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html))



Examining message folders  
---
- Like filesystem, messages are files organized in folders
- actions such as download, search, or modify are taken on the messages in the current or selected folder
- IMAP protocol is stateful so it remembers the pwd in one connection
  - reconnection starts freshly in the root folder


Message Numbers vs. UIDs
---
- A specific message within a folder can be identified by one of two different ways
  - a temporary message number assigned during each session
  - a unique identifier (UID) persists through sessions
    - used in synchronization between local and remote
    - if the folder is renamed or deleted from one client, the remote uid will conflict with local uid on other clients
    - check *UIDVALIDITY* in new session to assure uid consistence with previous session
  - use temporary message number only by setting *use_uid=False*
- message numbers can be specified in ranges such as
  - 2,4:6,20:* means message 2, 4 to 6, and 20 to the end
  - efficient for processing by commands that support multiple messages


Summary Information
---
- IMAP server provides some summary information about selected folder
  - the folder itself and its messages
- The summary returned by IMAPClient is a dictionary
- the keys that most IMAP servers will return when you run *select_folder()*
  - servers are only required to return FLAGS, EXISTS, and RECENT
    - most will also include UIDVALIDITY

| key | description |
| --- | --- |
| EXISTS | An integer giving the number of messages in the folder |
| FLAGS  | A list of the flags that can be set on messages in this folder  |
| RECENT  |  Specifies the server‚Äôs estimate of the number of messages that have appeared in the folder since the last time an IMAP client ran select_folder() on it  |
| UIDVALIDITY  | A string that can be used by clients to verify that the UID numbering has not changed  |
| PERMANENTFLAGS  | Specifies the list of custom flags that can be set on messages; this is usually empty  |
| UIDNEXT  | The server‚Äôs guess about the UID that will be assigned to the next incoming (or uploaded) message  |
| UNSEEN  | Specifies the message number of the first unseen message (the one without the \Seen flag) in the folder  |


üñäÔ∏è Practice
---
- [Displaying Folder Summary Information](./imap/folder_info.py)
  ```python
  python3 folder_info.py localhost seed Inbox
  ```


üñäÔ∏è Download an Entire Mailbox
---
- IMAPClient downloads mail using its *fetch() method* wrapping IMAP FETCH command
- all messages in a folder can be downloaded at once or individually
- [Downloading All Messages in a Folder](./imap/folder_summary.py)
  ```python
  python3 folder_summary.py localhost seed Inbox
  ```
