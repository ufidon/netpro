- [Electronic mail (email or e-mail)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) is a method of transmitting and receiving messages using electronic devices
- The lifespan of an email
  - A sender $S$ submit an email $e$ by the *Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP:25)* to an email server $S_s$
    - SMTP Secure (SMTPS) uses port number 587
      - Port 465 is also used sometimes but outdated
  - $e$ is delivered from $S_s$ through a serials of intermediary email servers $S_{m_i}$ to the receiver $R$'s email server $S_r$
  - $R$ accesses $e$ from $S_r$ through the *Post Office Protocol v3 (POP3:110)* or the *Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP:143)* using email clients such as
    - Mozilla Thunderbird, Microsoft Outlook
    - webmail services are prevalent today which let users
      - log on the email server with a web browser 
      - view their emails rendered as HTML 
      - the e-mails remain on the email server
    - the secured versions of POP3 and IMAP are *POP3S:995* and *IMAPS:993* respectively

sudo systemctl status dovecot
ss -l lpt # lnpt
telnet localhost smtp
telnet localhost pop3

E-Mail
---
- represented as plain ASCII text 
  - using character codes 1 through 127
  - other standards are supplemented to support Unicode characters and binary payloads
- the end-of-line marker is CRLF (carriage-return linefeed, \r\n, ASCII: 13,10 )
- consists of 
  - headers
    - each header consists of a case-insensitive name, a colon, and a value
      - can stretch to several lines indented with whitespace except the first line 
  - a blank line 
  - the body
- E-Mail Message Format is defined in standard [RFC 5322](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322)


üí° Demo
---
- Go through the components of an email
  - especially the list of headers
- many of the headers were added by clients and servers along the email transmission
  - each client and server in route reserves the right to add additional headers
