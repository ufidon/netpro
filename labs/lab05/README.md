## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Programming

### Overview:
This lab introduces you to the fundamentals of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking by creating a simple file-sharing application using Python. You will incrementally implement a P2P program where multiple peers can connect, share files, and download files from each other.

In your report, 
- üéè explain the code you added or modified
- üíª illustrate with screenshots of corresponding outputs


### Lab Objectives:
1. Understand how P2P networks work, their major components, and work flows.
2. Build a simple P2P system where peers share files.
3. Gracefully handle peer connections and disconnections.
4. Implement peer discovery, file searching, and file requests between peers.

---

### Task 1: **Get Familiar with P2P Programming for File Sharing**

In this task, you will study a basic P2P system where each peer (node) can act as both a client and a server. This will help you understand the flow of file sharing in a P2P network.

üéè **Understand the key components**:
   - `Server`: Waits for incoming connections from other peers and responds to requests.
   - `Client`: Connects to a peer and downloads requested files.
   - `Shared files directory`: Each peer has a folder containing the files it is willing to share.
   - `Console`: Command-based user interface, supports the commands below

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `help` / `?` | Show usage of all commands |
| `scan` | Discover active peers. For demonstration, limit the peer_ids range from 5000 to 5009.  |
| `lp` | List connected peers. |
| `connect <peer_id>` | Connect to a peer |
| `disconnect <peer_id>` | Disconnect from a peer |
| `sf <filename>` | Search for files on all connected peers |
| `request <filename> <peer_id>` | Request a file from a peer |
| `quit` | Quit the program |


üéè **Complete Task 1 in the basic P2P program**:  

- üéè Complete Task 1 in the basic P2P program [p2p0.py](./p2p0.py) provided.
  - üéè Implement command `help`, i.e. `?`, or newline only.
  - üéè Add usage to each command.
    ```python
    # Reference code, for example
    elif commands[0] == "connect":  # connect peer_id
        if len(commands) == 2:
            print(f'Connect to peer {commands[1]}')
        else:
            print('Usage: connect <peer_id>')
    ```
  - üñ•Ô∏è Explain your code in the report and illustrate with output screenshots
- üéè Describe the major components of this P2P program and how they work together
- üéè Describe a complete file request scenario:
  - start the program
  - find active peers
  - connect to active peers
  - search for files
  - request for files
  - disconnect from peers
  - quit the program

- üñ•Ô∏è Sample output

### Task 2: **Discover and Connect Peers in a P2P Framework**

Finding peers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network is a crucial step in establishing connections between 
nodes. Typically peers can be found starting from a bootstrap list of peers. This list typically contains a small number 
of well-connected and stable peers in the network. Once connected to a seed peer, you discover other peers in the network by querying the seed peer for 
information about nearby peers. This can be done using a protocol such as:

- DHT (Distributed Hash Table) queries
- Peer-to-peer gossip protocols
- Social networking-style updates

Then, you store the discovered peers locally and update the local peer list periodically to reflect changes in the 
network.

For simplicity, you run all nodes on the same computer so you use `port number` as `node/peer id`, and the node ids range from `5000 to 5009`. 

In real-world P2P networks:
- The number of nodes are not limited
- The `id` of a node is NOT bound to its port number. IP addresses and GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifications) may be used.

üéè Complete Task 2 on the basic P2P program `p2p1.py` you completed in Task 1.
  - üéè Discover active peers, i.e. implement command `scan`.
  - üéè List connected peers, i.e. implement command `lp`.
  - üéè Connect to selected peers, update the list of connected peers, i.e. implement command `connect <peer_id>`.
  - üéè Disconnect from selected peers, update the list of connected peers as well, i.e. implement command `disconnect <peer_id>`.
  - üñ•Ô∏è Explain your code in the report and illustrate with output screenshots

### Task 3: **Search for Shared Files**

In this task, you will 
- üéè implement functionality to search for specified shared files on the connected peers.
- üéè handle `search requests` from peers.

Since each peer maintains a list of known peers (IP and port), port (peer id) only in this simplified lab, to connect to, you can implement a mechanism to ask for a shared file from its connected peers only for simplicity.

#### Reference Code:

```python
# Function to handle file searches and requests from connected peers
# - SRCH filename
# - REQ filename
def handle_peer(self, response_socket, peer_id):
    while not self.evExit.is_set():
        msg = response_socket.recv(1024)
        if not msg:
            print(f'Peer {peer_id} closed connection.')
            with self.lock:
                self.response_sockets.pop(peer_id)
            break
        print(f"Received message from {peer_id}: {msg}")
        cmds = msg.decode().strip().split()

        # 1. handle SRCH filename
        if (len(cmds) == 0) or (not cmds[0]):
            print('Empty message.')
        elif (cmds[0] == 'SRCH') and cmds[1]:
            filename = cmds[1]
            file_path = os.path.join(self.shared_dir, filename)
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                hint = f'150 {filename} found.'   
            else:
                hint = f'450 {filename} not found.'
            print(f"Response to peer {peer_id}:  {hint}")
            response_socket.sendall(hint.encode())             

        # 2. handle REQ file name
        elif (cmds[0] == 'REQ') and cmds[1]:
          pass
        else:
            print('Unknown message.')
            pass

# Function to search for a file from another peer
def search_file(self, filename):
    # you search among the connected peers only
    msg = f'SRCH {filename}'
    lostconnections = []
    for pid, psock in self.request_sockets.items():
        psock.sendall(msg.encode())

        # Receive response
        data = psock.recv(1024)
        if not data:
            print(f'Peer {pid} disconnected.')
            lostconnections.append[pid]
            break
        response = data.decode().strip()
        print(f"{response[4:-1]} on {pid}")
    
    # remove peers disconnected
    with self.lock:
        for p in lostconnections:
            self.request_sockets.pop(p)
```

### Task 4: **Download Files from Peers**

In this task, you will implement the file download functionality, where one peer can request a file from another peer and download it.

- üéè **File Request**:  
   Implement a function that requests a specific file from a peer.

- üéè **Send File**:  
   When a peer requests a file, the other peer should send the file over the connection.

- üéè **Receive and Save the File**:  
   The requesting peer should receive the file data and save it in its shared directory.

#### Reference Code:

```python
# Handle REQ file name in `handle_peer`
file_path = os.path.join(self.shared_dir, filename)
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    # let's use TCP stream framing `Length-prefix` here
    # since you don't close the connection after each request
    hint = f'250 {filename} found.'

    lhint = f'{hint:40}' # 40 bytes for the response
    print(f"Response to peer {peer_id}:  {hint}")
    response_socket.sendall(lhint.encode())


# Function to request a file from another peer
def request_file(self, peer_id, filename):
    msg = f'REQ {filename}'
    # requests a specific file from a peer.
    self.request_sockets[peer_id].sendall(msg.encode())
    
    # Receive response
    # Receive and Save the File
    response = self.recvall(peer_id, 40)
    if response[:3] == b'250':
        prefix = self.recvall(peer_id, 4)
        data_length = struct.unpack('!I', prefix)[0]
        data = self.recvall(peer_id, data_length)

        file_path = os.path.join(self.shared_dir, filename)
        with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(data)        
        print(f"{response[4:-1].decode().strip()[:-1]} on {peer_id}. {data_length} bytes received.")
    else:
        print(f"{response[4:-1].decode().strip()[:-1]} on {peer_id}.")
# receive a block of message with specified length
def recvall(self, peer_id, length):
    blocks = []
    while length:
        block = self.request_sockets[peer_id].recv(length)
        if not block:
            print(f'Peer {peer_id} disconnected.')
            # remove peers disconnected
            with self.lock:
                self.request_sockets.pop(peer_id)

            raise EOFError('socket closed with {} bytes left'
                        ' in this block'.format(length))
        length -= len(block)
        blocks.append(block)
    return b''.join(blocks)

### Lab Conclusion:
In this lab, you learned how to create a simple P2P file-sharing system in Python. You implemented console-based interaction, peer discovery, file requests, and graceful shutdown of peers. This lab provides a foundation for more advanced P2P concepts, such as peer discovery protocols and distributed file systems.

### Optional Improvements
- Connection pooling and caching
- Peer reputation systems
- Network topology management
- Authenticate and Authorize
  * Username/password authentication
  * Digital certificates or public key infrastructure (PKI)
  * Token-based authentication
- Discover Other Peers
  * DHT (Distributed Hash Table) queries
  * Peer-to-peer gossip protocols
  * Social networking-style updates
- Store and Update Local Peer List
  - Store the discovered peers locally and update the local peer list periodically to reflect changes in the network.
- Handle various exceptions
- Search for files recursively like a web crawler?
